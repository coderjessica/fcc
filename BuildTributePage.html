                        <h3>1965</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                                Pink Floyd Sound is created after a couple of years of bandmates coming and going.<br>
                                The band consisted of Bob Klose and Roger Waters both on guitars, Nick Mason was the
                                drummer,
                                Rick Wright played the keyboard and the lead vocalist was Chris Dennis. Before the
                                group's first
                                single, Klose left and Dennis was replaced by Syd Barrett.<br>
                                "Arnold Layne" was recorded but not released.</p>
                        <h3>1966</h3>
                        <p class="text">The group is picked up by Peter Jenner and Andrew King as producers, and they
                                dropped "Sound"
                                from their name, becoming "Pink Floyd".</p>
                        <h3>1967</h3>
                        <p class="text">The group signed on with EMI and received an advance of 5,000 EU dollars,
                                equivilent to almost
                                100,000 today.<br>
                                "Arnold Layne" and later, "See Emily Play" are released.<br>
                                <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em> is released and reaches #6, spending 14 weeks on
                                the UK
                                album chart.<br>
                                Barrett has a mental break down and is using LSD. He stops responding during interviews
                                and even
                                live shows. This led to his replacement by David Gilmour in December.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1969</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>Ummagumma</em> is released.<br>
                                Pink Floyd began departing from their earlier works. Their 1969 album peaked at #5,
                                spending 21
                                weeks on the UK album chart.</p>
                        <h3>1970</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> is released.<br>
                                Pink Floyd has their first #1 album, it spent 18 weeks on the UK album chart.</p>
                        <h3>1971</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>Meddle</em> is released.
                                The LP peaked at #3 and spent 82 weeks on the UK album chart.<br>
                                Includes a 23 minute song.</p>
                        <h3>1973</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> is released.<br>
                                Waters is the sole author of the lyrics.<br>
                                The album is one of the most commercially successfull rock albums of all time; a US
                                #1.<br>
                                It remained on the <em>Billboard</em> chart for nearly 20 years, still holding the
                                record of the
                                longest running <em>Billboard</em> album as of 2021.<br>
                                This album is the world's third best-selling album, and the 21st best-selling album of
                                all time
                                in the US.</p>
                        <h3>1975</h3>
                        <em>Wish You Were Here</em> is released.<br>
                        Their last album had left Pink Floyd emotionally drained and their new album was composed purely
                        by Gilmour, which reminded Waters of Barrett.<br>
                        Pink Floyd was working on the album when Barrett randomly visited. Although he talked for a bit,
                        he wasn't really there. The band didn't recognize him initially.<br>
                        This album reached #1 in both the US and the UK.
                        <h3>1977</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>Animals</em> is released.<br>
                                Recorded in 1976 at 35 Britanna Row, <em>Animals</em> was a concept loosely based on
                                George
                                Orwell's <em>Animal Farm</em>.<br>
                                There were many issues between band members at this time, in addition to their own
                                personal
                                problems. Gilmour and Waters disagreed about royalties, Wright had marital problems and
                                issues
                                with Waters' ego.<br>
                                Gilmour also felt as if they had accomplished the success they sought after, and had
                                nothing
                                left to achieve.<br>
                                Their 1977 album peaked on the UK chart at #2 and the US chart at #3.</p>
                        <h3>1979</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>The Wall</em> is released.<br>
                                Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. One was eventually <em>The
                                        Wall</em>
                                while the other ended up as Waters' first solo album.<br>
                                The album was based on the story of a character called Pink who was inspired by Waters'
                                childhood, most notably his father's death. The first "brick" led to more problems,
                                enter drugs
                                and depression revolving around the music industry. Pink would transform into a
                                megalomaniac,
                                partially revolving around the decline of Barrett. Eventually Pink would tear down the
                                wall and
                                become a normal person again.<br>
                                During the recording of this album, the band was not impressed with the little effort
                                Wright was
                                putting towards the band and was kicked out.<br>
                                The album topped the <em>Billboard</em> chart in the US for 15 weeks and reached #3 in
                                the UK.</p>
                        <h3>1983</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>The Final Cut</em> is released.<br>
                                The lyrics for this 1983 album were written solely by Waters, who also did all of the
                                music. It
                                was considered, in part, to be Waters solo album.<br>
                                After <em>The Final Cut</em>, the band had a meeting in 1984 to discuss the future of
                                Pink
                                Floyd. Waters was doing a solo tour for his own album, Wright (kicked from the band),
                                had formed
                                another band, and Mason released his second solo album.<br>
                                Waters left the meeting with the understanding that Pink Floyd was done while the other
                                two left
                                thinking they would resume once Waters was done with his solo tour.<br>
                                Once the miscommunication became apparent, legal battles ensued over the band name.</p>
                        <h3>1994</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>The Division Bell</em> is released.<br>
                                Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked together to create this 1994 album, and it reached #1
                                in both
                                the US and UK, spending 51 weeks on the UK album chart.</p>
                        <h3>2014</h3>
                        <p class="text"> <em>The Endless River</em> is released.<br>
                                Gilmour and Mason, without Waters, revisited recordings taken during <em>The Division
                                        Bell</em>
                                sessions. Mason said the album was a tribute to Wright.<br>
                                It became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and the fastest-selling in
                                2014.</p>
                        <h3>Where are they now?</h3>
                        <p class="text"> Syd Barrett was the first of the band members to pass, dying in his home in
                                Cambridge at the age
                                of 60 in 2006.<br>
                                Rick Wright passed in 2008 from cancer at the age of 65.<br>
                                Nick Mason formed a new band in 2018 to perform Pink Floyd's early material.<br>
                                Roger Waters released his first solo album in 25 years in 2017 and even joined Mason on
                                stage in
                                2019.<br>
                                David Gilmour still writes and performs music as of 2020.</p>
