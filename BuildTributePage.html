                    Pink Floyd Sound is created after a couple of years of bandmates coming and going.<br>
                    The band consisted of Bob Klose and Roger Waters both on guitars, Nick Mason was the drummer, Rick Wright played the keyboard and the lead vocalist was Chris Dennis. Before the group's first single, Klose left and Dennis was replaced by Syd Barrett.<br>
